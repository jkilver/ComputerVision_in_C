Redoing my CV 6476 homework in C/C++ instead of Python for practice

I need more practice in C++ for some of the jobs I want. Since most of those jobs will require
computer vision, I thought a good way to practice would be to redo some previous computer vision
homework in this language.

Assuming that OpenCV 2.4.9 installed. The latest now is 3.2, so I will be using that.

Using Visual Studio 2015 as my development environment. I found this post helpful in getting OpenCV working. Note that since this is for 3.0, some of the files are named different (320 rather than 300)
